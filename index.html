									<h1>This page is still under construction... proceed with caution</h1>
									<p>Inspired by Alex Lang's GRFP Help site, this webpage will provide you with the most up to date examples of winnning essays. 
										All the essays are sourced with permission from winners themselves. 
										This page is designed by astronomers; as such, the examples are mostly in the field of astronomy. However, we encourage submissions from all fields. 
										Given the changing NSF and government guidelines, I hope you find these useful. </p>
										<p> To all who have submitted essays, thank you!</p>

									<h2>General Advice & Information</h2>
									<p> The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded their <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a> 
										(GRFP) to promising scientists since 1952. 
										Students who are pursuing full-time research-based master's and doctoral STEM degrees apply for the award in the fall (October/November) and typically receive results in April. 
										Awarded students are given three years of funding (usable over a five-year fellowship period) where $37,000 is allocated to the student
										and $16,000 is allocated to their university for educational expenses. 
									</p>
									<p>To check your eligibility and the current guidelines <b>READ THE CURRENT SOLICITATION!</b> 
										(<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program/nsf25-547/solicitation" target="_blank">2025/2026 linked here</a>).
										The NSF has been updating its website and guidelines, so some information may be conflicting between webpages. The solicitation contains eligibility information,
										due dates, and reviewing guidelines (i.e. explainations of the "Intellectual Merits" and "Broader Imapacts" criteria).</p>
									<p>Good general advice is to apply if you can find the time! Regardless of if you get the award or not, 
										you have gained valuable research grant writing practice. 
										Additionally, if you are applying for graduate school, your personal statement can easily be repurposed into application statements, 
										so you will be extra confident in your writing!
									</p>
